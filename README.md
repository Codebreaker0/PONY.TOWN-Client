## The Client
The goal of this project is to give you a desktop application for the Game/Community website [Pony Town](https://pony.town/) and have it run cleaner and faster without any need of your web browser. You can get the current version of the game from bellow.

## The Game
The entire game is written in [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/), a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. Server side code is running on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) server with WebSockets for communication. User interface is built using [Angular.js](https://angularjs.org/) framework and the game itself is using WebGL for rendering graphics.
